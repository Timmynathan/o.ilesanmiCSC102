# 🐍 CSC 102 – Python Weekly Projects

This repository contains my weekly programming exercises for **CSC 102: Introduction to Computer Science**, completed during my first year. All code was written in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**, and focuses on fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control structures, basic arithmetic, and data structures.

## 📌 Projects & Topics Covered

### 🧮 Finance Calculations
- **Simple Interest Calculator**
- **Compound Interest Calculator**
- **Annuity Plan Calculator**

These projects use formulas and arithmetic operations to simulate real-world financial computations.

### 👥 Student Data Display
- Created structured student data using lists
- Iterated over student records using `for` loops
- Displayed **names, ages, heights, and scores** in a readable tabular format for:
  - **GIRLS DATA**
  - **BOYS DATA**

### 💼 Tax Revenue Calculator (Conditionals)
- A fintech-themed script that uses **if-elif-else** statements to determine annual tax revenue
- Takes input for age and experience to determine tax band
- Demonstrates logical operators and user input handling
